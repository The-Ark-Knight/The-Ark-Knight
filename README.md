In my universe, technology is not just a tool but a canvas, where I paint with data and sculpt with algorithms. Here, you'll find a blend of projects that showcase my expertise in AI, Data Science, and my love for immersive video game experiences. 🌟

## My Work

Each repository in this portfolio is a testament to my dedication and an invitation to explore the realms I'm passionate about. From intricate data models to the vast expanses of virtual worlds, each project is a story waiting to be told.
